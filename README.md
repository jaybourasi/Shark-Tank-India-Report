## Shark-Tank-India-Report
I created a report on "Shark Tank India," analyzing the investment dynamics and performance of startups featured on the show. I cleaned and organized the dataset to ensure accuracy, conducted detailed analyses to identify trends, and developed actionable insights for entrepreneurs and investors. Additionally, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to present these insights effectively.

Tools I Used:
Excel: For data organization and cleaning.
SQL: For data querying and manipulation.
Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard.
